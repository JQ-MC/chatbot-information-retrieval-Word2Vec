Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him? 	 That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital. 	 He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.  
Oh, God. What happened? Here, lie down. 	 But he started to feel nauseous on the way back.  I'm sure it's concussion.

They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally. 	 Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
