. .  I don't know what to do.  	Ah, what... who are you?
Hold on. Tell me who's dead.	Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just...
Yeah. He's really dead. He just...	Listen. Call an ambulance. Where are you?
Have you got a car?	Yes.
Yes.	Call an ambulance. Then get out of there. Okay? Okay?
How long this time? Two weeks?	Yeah, let's have this conversation again. Like you haven't just done six weeks on the road...
Phil, you give me laughs and a great time. But I'm not sure if that's enough.	You mean there's more than that?
I'll put you in touch.  	You have to choose something to represent.  
You have to choose something to represent.  	I represent the combined forces of charm, enchantment and exuberance.
Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny.	That's not a will Barbara, and you know it.
Guitar?	Yes. Gram's guitar. He always kept it here.
I don't know what this madness is, but I'm not getting involved.	Well, that's the point.
Well, that's the point.	I mean, I don't know what it is you're planning, but I'm not bailing you out again.
I mean, I don't know what it is you're planning, but I'm not bailing you out again.	Right.
Right.	I'm going.
Right.	Who are you, please?
Who are you, please?	Oh, I'm Phil Kaufman.
Oh, I'm Phil Kaufman.	And how may I help you, Phil Kaufman?
And how may I help you, Phil Kaufman?	I'd like to hire your car.
I'd like to hire your car.	Why?
Why?	Well, I need to pick someone up at the airport.
Well, I need to pick someone up at the airport.	Don't you know anyone with a car?
Don't you know anyone with a car?	Yes, of course. It's just that I'm told your car is more suitable.
Yes, of course. It's just that I'm told your car is more suitable.	I see. In what way is my car more suitable?
I see. In what way is my car more suitable?	Well... it's a hearse.
And how is a hearse going to be suitable for picking someone up from the airport?	It's... a joke.
That might be my point.	So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse?
So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse?	I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse.
Okay. Where are the keys?	Why?
Why?	I gotta go. Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again.
What's the matter?	Nothing.
Nothing.	Well... What flight are they on?
Well... What flight are they on?	We'll wait here.
We'll wait here.	Okay. Well, what time is the flight due?
Okay. Well, what time is the flight due?	Soon.
Soon.	Okay. How soon?
Okay. How soon?	Why do you ask so many damn questions?
Shouldn't we be at arrivals?	Look, will you please shut up asking me stuff?
He slams the door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom.  Phil doesn't move.  	The drivers' door opens and Larry gets back into the car.
You've just arrived from New Orleans, mister Parsons?	Yes.
Yes.	And you're flying directly back to New Orleans? On the same plane?
No you're not.	Yes I am.
You're one of those funny guys, right.	Yeah, but it's my day off.
Yeah, but it's my day off.	Name?
Name?	Mine or the...?
 Barbara is now sobbing, and the bank manager is becoming increasing uncomfortable He gives her his handkerchief.  	No... I do... understand, Miss Mansfield. Really I do.
No... I do... understand, Miss Mansfield. Really I do.	Please tell me how I'm supposed to get my money.
Please tell me how I'm supposed to get my money.	Well I imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead.
Well I imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead.	Are you saying that I'm lying?
Space ma game, kinda. Partitions. Fixed. Slidin'. Demountable. Integrated.	Right.
Right.	Always say. Why have one room? When you can have two?
Well... Gone.	Gone? Whaddya mean, gone?
Gone? Whaddya mean, gone?	We got the wrong box. Your box is being loaded.
I thought you were taking him to New Orleans?	What?
So whatcha doing here?	We're meeting someone off a flight.
We're meeting someone off a flight.	You're meeting someone off a flight?
You're meeting someone off a flight?	Yes.
Yes.	In a hearse?
In a hearse?	Yes. It's a... surprise.
What the hell does that mean?	I don't like them and I don't know what to say to them. They make me feel uneasy.
Fantastic. Well done.	Oh, right. So it's all my fault?
Jesus... What now?	Get out.
C'mon, we gotta keep moving.	Get out and take your friend with you.
Get out.	Stop saying that! I can't get out.
Stop saying that! I can't get out.	Why not?
Why not?	Larry slips the car into gear and it moves forward.  
What the hell are you doing?	I'm driving back to the mortuary.
As new?	Well I'm not sure the 'one careful owner' thing works with coffins.
Well I'm not sure the 'one careful owner' thing works with coffins.	The whole thing is completely immoral.
The whole thing is completely immoral.	Just think of it as recycling.  
Just think of it as recycling.  	Look, I really need to get home.
Look, I really need to get home.	Why?
So just settle back and enjoy the ride.  Larry slows the car down.  	What now?
We could go back.	Why would we want to do that?
Why would we want to do that?	I haven't packed any spare clothes.  We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow.  
I haven't packed any spare clothes.  We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow.  	You want to go home to pick up fresh clothes?
And then drive back out tomorrow?	We could do that.
We could do that.	Just drive the car, okay?
Just drive the car, okay?	We could just...
We could just...	No.
No.	It would...
Well... It... It's a big car. A big yellow car. Two guys inside.	Was one of 'em sick in them bushes?
What are we going to do?	Time.
Time.	What?
The steering lock is on.	Well... turn it off!
I know he's dead, Honey. But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death.	I don't understand.
I don't understand.	Let's just say I'm overly sentimental, okay?
Let's just say I'm overly sentimental, okay?	This is all about money, isn't it?
This is all about money, isn't it?	Isn't everything?
Isn't everything?	Why do you think you deserve anything?
Why do you think you deserve anything?	I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party.
I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party.	Phil's not responsible for your problems with Gram.
Phil's not responsible for your problems with Gram.	What do you know?
Maybe that's what I like about him.	Sure it is, honey. That's why your bags were packed.
You saw what happened. I drove over that cop's bike. That's destruction of police property, or something.	You worry too much.
'Dinoburgers, Reptile Steaks and Primeval Soup. Titanosaurion portions, prehistoric pricing. Liquor served'.	Pull over - let's... eat.
You frighten him.	I do not.
It's probably the rabbit food.	Look, I'm a vegetarian. I have a problem with dead flesh. Okay?
Good afternoon.	Yup.
Yup.	Do you have a telephone I might use?
Beer. The barman gives Stanley his beer.	Would you put a scotch in there, please?
Yeaaaaah. Yeah, a real bad day.	What happened?
Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons dead?	Better get going.
Better get going.	He said someone took Gram Parson's body. Two people...
He said someone took Gram Parson's body. Two people...	Anyway, although that's real interesting, we've gotta keep to the schedule.  
Anyway, although that's real interesting, we've gotta keep to the schedule.  	Schedule? What schedule? There is no schedule...
Well, technically, we stole Gram Parsons.	I stole a coffin, I didn't know there was a body in it.
Gram was an adult. He didn't need a nursemaid.	Except that now he's dead.
Yeah?	Hi.
A hippie hit it. I thought you'd gone.	Hold that thought.
Hold that thought.	What the hell does that mean?
You know I can't let you do that?	I know you have to. Stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table. Everyone jumps.
I know you have to. Stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table. Everyone jumps.	!  This was MY son !  How dare you try to take my grief away from me 
!  This was MY son !  How dare you try to take my grief away from me 	It's too late to claim him now.
It means that you learned to care too late.  That's what it means.  	I don't have to justify my relationship with Gram to you.
I understand that you were his right-hand man, as well as his friend?	I was both, yes.
Yes. That's right.	So the guilt isn't all mine, then?
What's that for?	That's for failing to reinforce my expectations.
May I see your driving license please, ma'am?	My driving license?
My driving license?	Please.
 He notices that Larry has made no move to help Susie sits on a rock and watches.  	As they lower it, the coffin slips out of Phil's hands and bangs down in the sand.  
Take the top off.	Why?
Why?	Flesh burns easier than wood.
Hey, man. Looking a little peaky...	Some decorum would be nice.
Nice wheels. Very stylish.	They're very handy for transporting dead people around. Nothing better.
They're very handy for transporting dead people around. Nothing better.	I am dead, then?
I am dead, then?	You're more than dead, Gram. You and the box are down to bones and brass.
What can I do for you, Gram?	You assume I want something.
Well, I s'pose I should be getting along.	Goodbye, Gram. I'm glad it all worked out.
Goodbye, Gram. I'm glad it all worked out.	What?
