The screen flips around to face him.  The video stewardess points down the corridor.  	Take Elevator D to deck seven. Your cabin number is on your shipcard.
And none is more beautiful than Homestead II, the Jewel of the Occupied Worlds.	Jim sits wearily, chin propped on his hand. The Video Instructor chatters on. Inspiring footage of Homestead II.
We're all on the Starship Excelsior. Five thousand passengers and fifty- eight crew members.	But I'm the only one awake.
But I'm the only one awake.	No, all the passengers wake up at the same time.
No, all the passengers wake up at the same time.	Then something's wrong with the other hibernation pods.
Then something's wrong with the other hibernation pods.	Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

Oblivious.  A sign catches Jim's attention: "OBSERVATORY - Your Place In the Universe. " 	! " Jim goes to the control podium Touches the screen.  
! " Jim goes to the control podium Touches the screen.  	What can I show you?
What can I show you?	We're supposed to land pretty soon, but it looks like I'm the only one awake. Is that normal?
Homestead II is the fourth planet in the Bhakti system.	Right. And how soon are we landing?
Right. And how soon are we landing?	Approximately ninety years.
How do I make a phone call?	Your cabin telephone...
Your cabin telephone...	No. Long distance. How do I send a message to Earth?
No. Long distance. How do I send a message to Earth?	Speak to the Duty Officer in the Comm Center.  ONSCREEN: The Infomat displays a helpful map.  
Begin message. Jim's a deer in the headlights. He collects himself.	Thanks.  Jim pushes the "SEND" button.  Sits back in his chair.  
Thanks.  Jim pushes the "SEND" button.  Sits back in his chair.  	Message sent.

Android, technically. Arthur's the name.	I'm Jim. Arthur shakes his hand.
I'm Jim. Arthur shakes his hand.	Pleased to meet you. What'll it be?
Arthur, how much do you know about the ship?	I don't know. I know some things.
I don't know. I know some things.	What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?
What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?	Impossible. Hibernation pods are fail- safe.
Impossible. Hibernation pods are fail- safe.	Yeah, well, I woke up early.
Ninety years or so.	And when are all of us passengers supposed to wake up?
And when are all of us passengers supposed to wake up?	Not until the last two months.
Not until the last two months.	?  Arthur's eyes take on a faraway look His head twitches.  
?  Arthur's eyes take on a faraway look His head twitches.  	It's not possible for you to be here. He smiles as if he's solved the problem.
I'm your only customer, but you're always polishing a glass.	Trick of the trade. Makes people nervous when a bartender just stands there.
Trick of the trade. Makes people nervous when a bartender just stands there.	I'm lost in space here.  Arthur polishes the bar while he thinks that one over.  
I'm lost in space here.  Arthur polishes the bar while he thinks that one over.  	You're not where you want to be. You feel like you're supposed to be somewhere else. Right?
You're not where you want to be. You feel like you're supposed to be somewhere else. Right?	You said it.
You said it.	Back on Earth, or on Homestead II.  
Back on Earth, or on Homestead II.  	Okay.
Okay.	That's not a crisis, it's the human condition.  Jim takes a moment to consider that.  
That's not a crisis, it's the human condition.  Jim takes a moment to consider that.  	That's not me.
Take a break.  Live a little.  Jim spins on his barstool, surveying the Grand Concourse.  	Live a little. When he comes back around he gives a shove. He spins faster.
[Good for you! It's a beautiful language.]	You speak Russian!
You speak Russian!	Of course. We have Russian passengers.
Of course. We have Russian passengers.	From now on, every time I sit down, I want a drink I haven't had before.  
From now on, every time I sit down, I want a drink I haven't had before.  	Jim takes a sip and makes a horrible face.  
Jim takes a sip and makes a horrible face.  	What's that?
Did you know ninety percent of the businesses in the world are owned by just eight companies?	Is that right?
Is that right?	She's good. She knows her stuff, and she's not afraid of anybody.
She's good. She knows her stuff, and she's not afraid of anybody.	Who's that?
Who's that?	Aurora.
Aurora.	Who's Aurora?
Would you make the wish? 	I don't know. I've never been on an island.
I don't know. I've never been on an island.	I mean, what if it made your life a thousand times better ?  How do you do the math? 
I mean, what if it made your life a thousand times better ?  How do you do the math? 	Jim. These are not robot questions. Jim stares at Arthur in frustration.
Jim. These are not robot questions. Jim stares at Arthur in frustration.	I know how to wake up Aurora.
I'd be stranding her on this ship for the rest of her life!	Oh. Well, you can't do that. Jim buries his face in his hands.
Oh. Well, you can't do that. Jim buries his face in his hands.	What am I going to do?
Passenger or crew?	Passenger. Jim Preston. He sticks out a hand. She shakes it firmly. Electric for Jim. First contact.

Do you know what's happening? Nobody else in my row woke up.	Yeah, I...same for me.
Yeah, I...same for me.	The crew's supposed to wake up a month before we do. But I haven't seen anybody. Jim swallows hard.
The crew's supposed to wake up a month before we do. But I haven't seen anybody. Jim swallows hard.	I can see them in there but I can't get in.  Aurora stares at him.  
I can see them in there but I can't get in.  Aurora stares at him.  	You're saying nobody's awake?
Maybe there's another way to go to sleep. Did you check out the infirmary?	I looked around. It's the usual hospital stuff. Scanners, autodocs.
I looked around. It's the usual hospital stuff. Scanners, autodocs.	Did you look for ways of going to sleep?
Did you look for ways of going to sleep?	Not really.
Not really.	Well, Jim!
Well, Jim!	You think they've got suspended animation pills sitting around?
You think they've got suspended animation pills sitting around?	You don't know until you look. What about cargo? Maybe there's a hibernation machine in the hold.
You don't know until you look. What about cargo? Maybe there's a hibernation machine in the hold.	 It's mostly farming stuff, industrial machines We're not going to find a hibernation facility in a box.  
 It's mostly farming stuff, industrial machines We're not going to find a hibernation facility in a box.  	You don't know that! We have to think big here. Maybe we can build our own hibernation machine.
You don't know that! We have to think big here. Maybe we can build our own hibernation machine.	No, we can't.
No, we can't.	You're not even trying!
So who are you, Jim? I'm going to be seeing you around. I should know who I'm talking to.	I'm from Denver. Lived there all my life.
I'm from Denver. Lived there all my life.	What kind of work do you do?
What kind of work do you do?	Means I don't have a Ph. D.  
Means I don't have a Ph. D.  	I'm from Manhattan, so I had the attitude.

Sorry.	What for? It's time to sleep. In the morning we'll think of something brilliant.
What for? It's time to sleep. In the morning we'll think of something brilliant.	All right.
Everything important - the reactor, the gravity drive - it's all behind firewalls. There's no way through.	Oh.
Who are you going to tell?	?  Jim seems stunned by the question He hadn't thought about it in quite those words.  
?  Jim seems stunned by the question He hadn't thought about it in quite those words.  	You sleep your way to another planet and another century.  The ultimate geographical suicide.  
You sleep your way to another planet and another century.  The ultimate geographical suicide.  	I, uh...I never really...
I, uh...I never really...	Were you running away from something?
Were you running away from something?	No. Things were okay.
No. Things were okay.	So?
All you see here is five thousand suckers?	I see zeroes on the HomeStead Company's bottom line.
?  Aurora studies the sleeper: a barrel-chested man of 50 with gray temples and a jutting jaw 	Banker.
Banker.	Gardener. Jim moves down the row, peeks at another screen, covers it.
Gardener. Jim moves down the row, peeks at another screen, covers it.	Is this Madison, Donna, or Lola? Aurora peers: a birdlike young woman with long red hair.
Is this Madison, Donna, or Lola? Aurora peers: a birdlike young woman with long red hair.	She's too silly to be a Donna. I think she's a Lola.
She's too silly to be a Donna. I think she's a Lola.	Madison. Chef, accountant, or midwife?
Madison. Chef, accountant, or midwife?	She has to be a midwife. There's no way you made that one up.
She has to be a midwife. There's no way you made that one up.	She's a midwife. I didn't know they still had midwives. They move among the sleepers, quizzing each other.
She's a midwife. I didn't know they still had midwives. They move among the sleepers, quizzing each other.	Married, or strangers?
Sixteen, twenty-six, or thirty-six?	I'd almost say sixteen...twenty-six.
I'd almost say sixteen...twenty-six.	Right.
Right.	Politician, historian, or artist?
Politician, historian, or artist?	I don't know. Artist?
I don't know. Artist?	It doesn't say. But I'll tell you this: I like her. We'd be friends. Jim looks at Aurora seriously.
It doesn't say. But I'll tell you this: I like her. We'd be friends. Jim looks at Aurora seriously.	You think you can see that?
You think you can see that?	Don't you? Jim looks at the woman in the pod. Smiles.
A perspective no other writer has. Literary immortality.	And what's this amazing story?
And what's this amazing story?	The selling of the colonial dream.
The selling of the colonial dream.	Big plans.
 The curtain opens Aurora looks around in wonder.  A bundle of cables snakes down the aisle.  	Jim and Aurora sit.  A screen beside Jim lists movies.  
Jim and Aurora sit.  A screen beside Jim lists movies.  	He offers Aurora some.  
I found a drug that would put us in a coma indefinitely, and machines that would keep us alive.	Really?!
Really?!	But it's not suspended animation. We'd still be aging.
But it's not suspended animation. We'd still be aging.	Oh.
Oh.	So that was a failure.  
So that was a failure.  	A highly ambitious failure.
A highly ambitious failure.	"A Highly Ambitious Failure," by Aurora Dunn.  Jim laughs.  He thinks for a minute.  
Thank you. I had an amazing time. A great night.	Yeah, me too. Well, good night. He turns to go.
Hi.	Hi. How was your day?
Hi. How was your day?	But the book and the diary are running together.  I think I'm writing about us.  
But the book and the diary are running together.  I think I'm writing about us.  	Makes sense to me.

But I'll never see it.  They sit for a moment in glum contemplation.  	Did you find anything that could help us?
Did you find anything that could help us?	Aurora gasps.  Reaches out to touch them.  
Aurora gasps.  Reaches out to touch them.  	Are they real?
Thank you.	You're welcome. She looks into his eyes.
I tried not to.	You pulled me out of hibernation. You destroyed the rest of my life. You murdered me!
You pulled me out of hibernation. You destroyed the rest of my life. You murdered me!	That's a little strong...
That's a little strong...	You murdered me. I'm going to be sick. Oh, my God. I...I can't see. She gets up to leave.
It wasn't like that.	. . Oh, my God !  And I just ate it up.  Fake !  All fake !  
Short circuit across these two contacts, and then these two.  And cut these wires.  	Just like that.
Just like that.	Just like that.
Two separated ribs. Fracture of the right arm, radius and ulna. One fractured finger. Dislocated thumb.	Wrap his ribs and arm with smooth white bandages.  Jim shouts in shock.  
Wrap his ribs and arm with smooth white bandages.  Jim shouts in shock.  	A bottle of pills rattles into a tray in front of him.  
Hello, Jim. Whiskey?	Iced tea.
Iced tea.	Coming up. Are you getting my barstool dirty?
Coming up. Are you getting my barstool dirty?	If your hands are too clean, it means you're not making anything.  
If your hands are too clean, it means you're not making anything.  	And what are you making?
Jim sits reading an electronic slate. He looks up to find Aurora standing over him.	I need you. The last thing Jim expected to hear.
He throws a switch.  The lights come on.  Back to normal.  	All better. Aurora gives him a brittle smile and sits on the bed.
All better. Aurora gives him a brittle smile and sits on the bed.	So how are you doing? You all right?
Who did that? Jim raises a hand sheepishly. Gus shakes his head.	I can't even talk about that now. Who are you?
I can't even talk about that now. Who are you?	Jim Preston. Rate-two mechanic.
No. Gus sits down heavily, looking at Jim.	She knows?
She knows?	She knows. Gus thinks that over, shaking his head at the idea.
She knows. Gus thinks that over, shaking his head at the idea.	Gus starts putting his tools away.  Jim lays the electronic slate down beside him.  
Yeah.	So you know. What Jim did. Aurora's chin begins to tremble.
So you know. What Jim did. Aurora's chin begins to tremble.	Yeah, he told me.
Jim. Fix the ship.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	He straightens, squares his shoulders, and steps inside.  Turns to face them.  
There's trouble everywhere. Atmosphere systems, water systems, waste systems, robot control.	What's happening? Aurora goes to the worktable: its surface displays the diagnostic report. Thousands of faults and failures.
It's beautiful.	Scares the hell out of me.
A meteor.	New errors pop up on the diagnostic report.  
Does the data cable go in the "bus" port or the "through" port?	 Jim forces one cable after another into their sockets Aurora tires: the computer slides out of place.  
 Jim forces one cable after another into their sockets Aurora tires: the computer slides out of place.  	Hold it! Hold it!
Who's that?	The Captain. The sounds of the ejection wave come closer. Boom-chak.
