Mateo, say something!	Mateo is dead.
Sorry . . .	I'll tell you when!
Ernesto Martel. I know one of his granddaughters...	So he's dead.
So he's dead.	You knew him?
Diego told me yesterday that you finished the script.	I would like to add a final epilogue. It may not be necessary, but I'd like to write it.
I would like to add a final epilogue. It may not be necessary, but I'd like to write it.	I agreed to deliver the definitive version to the producer and director today.
It's still warm. Just downloaded from the eMule.	Dude. I'll throw it in now. You want something to drink?
Dude. I'll throw it in now. You want something to drink?	Yes. And you, would you like a tip of "crystal"?
You need anything?	No, thanks.
Of course. What's wrong with him?	Stomach cancer, metastasized.
I can't believe they have thrown you out of the hospital, like dogs...	Yes, honey, yes...
Yes?	Severine?
Hi! Has he already called?	Who?
I couldn't say no.	Things aren't done like that! Have you gone mad!?
I couldn't say no, he is one of my best clients.  	You bitch!
I am sorry to bother you...	You are never a bother.
You told me that he has stomach cancer. . .  	Yes.
Yes.	I'll meet you at the Clinica de la Luz in an hour. . .  
I'm Ray X ...	Ray X? There's no such a name.
Ray X? There's no such a name.	It's a nickname, at one time I took a lot of ecstasy.
It's a nickname, at one time I took a lot of ecstasy.	What do you want?
What do you want?	To write a script with you, so that I can direct it.
To write a script with you, so that I can direct it.	It's your first film?
Will you stand there all day?	You haven't given me Judit Garcia's phone number.
I love your work, I know it from the start.	Thank you.
Thank you.	I have seen all of Mateo Blanco's films, including the last one, "Girls and Suitcases".
Because he vanished from public life...	It would seem that way.
It would seem that way.	Almost as if he'd died.
Almost as if he'd died.	Yes . . . I lost track of him some time ago.
Yes . . . I lost track of him some time ago.	I've always been intrigued by the case of his last film.
I've always been intrigued by the case of his last film.	Whose?
Whose?	 You were the screenwriter for all of them, how do you explain that the last one was a disaster? 
... I would like to write a story about a son's revenge, one against the memory of his father.	Why does the son desire revenge?
I will pay whatever you ask.	It's too personal.
I think this is him...	Who?
He is now thinner and wears a beard, but it's him. He is talking to you.	What am I saying?
What am I saying?	I don't know. He is handing you something, it looks like a pack of cigarettes.
I don't know. He is handing you something, it looks like a pack of cigarettes.	It's a radio microphone. He is asking me to wear it and I am refusing it.
It's a radio microphone. He is asking me to wear it and I am refusing it.	Who is he?
Blackmailers!	Why don't you invite your son to spend a few days here?
. .  and whether you think there's any remedy. . .  	And how would I know?! What an idea!
And how would I know?! What an idea!	I am not asking you to fuck him, but you good-looking girls can tell these things.
If they love me and you don't set them against me, they will accept it.  	You should have told me before we married!
I hope not. Yes?	It's Judit Garcia.
It's Judit Garcia.	Oh, hello, Judit. Did you get the money?
You won't call me Ray? It's my artistic name...	Artistic? What are you up to?
Artistic? What are you up to?	Hoping to erase my father's name.
Hoping to erase my father's name.	And what does that have to do with Harry?
Ernesto, forget about us!	Don't be afraid of me. I am not my father.
You can leave without concerns. Don't worry about me.	I am also worried for Harry. Please, look after him during my absence...
I am also worried for Harry. Please, look after him during my absence...	I have things to do, mom. I can't look after him all day.
I have things to do, mom. I can't look after him all day.	It's only two weeks!
Summarize it!	Diego, please, this is not the moment.
Diego, please, this is not the moment.	It never is for you!
It never is for you!	!  Or I'll hire someone 
I'm not. I'm just keeping you company. How can you walk so fast?	I am training and I don't work at night, nor do I drug myself.
I am training and I don't work at night, nor do I drug myself.	What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?	That I take care of myself, with the fanaticism of an older, handicapped person.

You want to donate blood?	No, no... I was thinking that "Donate Blood" is a good title for a movie...
No, no... I was thinking that "Donate Blood" is a good title for a movie...	Yes. It has a good ring.
It's true.	 and they actually keep the blood they get from donors for their own consumption, of course. .  
 But even though they live in the shadows, they have amassed great social and economic power. .  	They control various industries. For example, the one responsible for dark sunglasses...
Protected by the sunscreen, they can function all day... The lotion must be as dense as armour.	Her body is a velvety pale, beautiful. . .

What a great opening! We also need a love story...	A hybrid love story, between the female vampire and a normal guy.
A hybrid love story, between the female vampire and a normal guy.	Like in "Cat People", a love story between beings of different species...
But they must like sex, right?	But when it comes to fucking, she becomes prudish. . .  
But when it comes to fucking, she becomes prudish. . .  	Why?
Why?	Because she is afraid of losing control in her excitement and taking a bite into his jugular...
Because she is afraid of losing control in her excitement and taking a bite into his jugular...	Aha.
Aha.	When they're horny, she lets him do everything, front, back, whatever he wants, except ravaging her mouth.
When they're horny, she lets him do everything, front, back, whatever he wants, except ravaging her mouth.	And her breasts?
And her breasts?	. .  
I like your story very much, Diego.	Our story.
 Why in the world did you get Coca-cola !  Didn't you notice he was drinking a jack and coke? 	I didn't realize!
I am here to see Diego Garcia.	Are you immediate family?
Are you immediate family?	Yes... I'm his uncle, and his godfather.
In a coma?	Yes...
Yes...	But, what has happened?!
But, what has happened?!	He ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol... it is a lethal combination. His friend informed us it was a mistake...
Barring any complications, he will recover in six to twelve hours.	If that's the case, I'll wait...
If that's the case, I'll wait...	Go home, we will call you...
Go home, we will call you...	I'd rather wait.

Would you mind providing us with his parents' phone number?	.  I don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly in a grave condition. . .  
.  I don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly in a grave condition. . .  	.  but, in any case, you should have a talk with him, once he's better. . .

I'm not sleepy anymore.	Do you want to talk?
Do you want to talk?	No...
No...	Would you like me to speak?
Would you like me to speak?	I don't know. If you'd like...
I don't know. If you'd like...	When I was young, before I got into making movies, I was very good at telling stories.  
When I was young, before I got into making movies, I was very good at telling stories.  	Well, then... would you mind telling me why my mother is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?
Before she left, she made me promise that I would remain alert, in case he reappeared...	She didn't explain why?
What's she like?	Too beautiful to be funny.
Too beautiful to be funny.	Really?
Really?	She is Ernesto Martel's lover, the tycoon. She is here with his son.

No. I've told you, he drank from the glass containing liquid ecstasy by mistake...	But how can one make a mistake with something like that?
Diego has not told you so that you wouldn't be alarmed...	Well, he hasn't succeeded. At some point he will have to speak to me, no?
You smell good...	I have put on some makeup and I am dressed as a woman.
I haven't changed much, Harry. I am wearing my hair short.	?  Like Joan of Arc on the bonfire ?  Like Liza Minnelli in "Cabaret" ?  Or like Yul Brynner?

Let me explain...	No. I am in a hideous mood, Judit, and I don't want to take it out on you!
Mateo, stop talking crazy!	It is not craziness. I can't think of anyone else to blame for Magdalena's death.
It is not craziness. I can't think of anyone else to blame for Magdalena's death.	My God! Wait a second... I have something to tell you.

And that cast on your leg?	His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the stairs...
How so?	In case Ivan arrived, he loves gazpacho.
 Since he wasn't calling, I've torn the phone from the wall, in a moment of rage. .  	. .  And the bed ?  I think I noticed it smoking a bit. . .
