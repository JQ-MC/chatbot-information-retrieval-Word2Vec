Don't give up.	I never do.
Redhead.	Luther. Your life would be a whole lot simpler if you could learn to operate a V.C.R.
I'll take that.	It's got their prints on it.
Kate. Kate.	Probably too late for me to take it up.
Probably too late for me to take it up.	The jogging.
Dumb way to start this, I guess.	Wanted to talk to you.
Wanted to talk to you.	About?
About?	Believe it or not, the weather. Nights are starting to get cold.
Believe it or not, the weather. Nights are starting to get cold.	That happens this time of year.
That happens this time of year.	. .  (still nothing) . . .  you're the only family I've got.  
I wish my carpets were this clean. And I can't find a single decent * fingerprint.	You serious, Laura?
You serious, Laura?	It's like Mary Poppins was here.
It's like Mary Poppins was here.	Could someone have let him in?
Could someone have let him in?	Sorry, Seth, but the entire Sullivan household went to Barbados two days ago.
I have to ask some questions, but it can be tomorrow.	You want what, positive identification? Yes, that was my wife. Anything else?
Eighty and alone, Mr. President.	He understands officially my hands are tied?
This thing's worse, Gloria. I need to see a doctor.	The country would have to be informed, Mr. President.
They're good. Beards and mustaches, too.	I try to give value for money. Leaving the country permanent?
Europe's fine. Maybe the Caribbean for winters. When can I pick up?	Usually takes some time, but for you, I'll rush it.
Usually takes some time, but for you, I'll rush it.	Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you.
Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you.	What?
What?	I don't want to know what you're into, but leaving forever...
See if any of this makes sense.	I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and surprise a burglar.
You Secret Service guys do that?	I was State Trooper here ten years ago before the Government got me.
I was State Trooper here ten years ago before the Government got me.	You're that Bill Burton.
Why haven't I ever heard of him?	Because he hasn't been arrested in thirty years.
Boy, you must be smart.	Sorry?
When?	There.  I just helped you.  Can I go back to work now? 
I need to look really good today.	Business? It's a woman, I can tell. (as Luther nods) Never too late, is it?
Got to.	Pardon?
I just need some sleep.	I've got a feeling he's going to try and contact you.  
I've got a feeling he's going to try and contact you.  	You're on a hot streak, I guess.
You said.	Feeble, huh?
Feeble, huh?	Anything for the road? I've got water and water.
You have to know I'm not a murderer.	Why'd you come then ?  You must have suspected something, or you wouldn't have been prepared.  
Why'd you come then ?  You must have suspected something, or you wouldn't have been prepared.  	My daughter wanted to see me.
My daughter wanted to see me.	Two guys came in, shot her dead.  
Two guys came in, shot her dead.  	The same two guys who tried for you this afternoon?
The same two guys who tried for you this afternoon?	Probably only one of them. I think Walter Sullivan might have hired the other.
Probably only one of them. I think Walter Sullivan might have hired the other.	Pretty powerful enemy; good going.
Pretty powerful enemy; good going.	Not as powerful as the President of the United States.
Jesus, Luther.	I know.
I know.	Can you run?
Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. President.	For? (off her, radiant, indicating the necklace) Come again?
What, Alan?	Christy Sullivan wore it the night * she was killed. *
... you're not going to kill me...	... why do you think that...?
... why do you think that...?	... you could have but you didn't...
Who else was in my house?	Secret Service shot her.
Secret Service shot her.	Nonsense.
That's not real proof.	And this?
And this?	You could have stolen this.
I did love her, you know.	Is he working late? I haven't an appointment but I'd like to see him if I might.
Watch it now.	... you don't have to fuss...
