He's signalling "okay."	Where's Gabe?
Still find the dead ones the old fashioned way, I guess.	You could have said goodbye.
Now.  	Christ. You're in charge of Rescue now?
Christ. You're in charge of Rescue now?	Maybe you heard about it.  The last guy lost his nerve and lit out of town.  
Goddamn it! Don't you see what he's doing! He's hijacking the fucking shipment! Don't make me shoot you!	Don't make me laugh.
I was almost used to you being gone.  Why are you here? 	But I came back for you, Maggie.  
But I came back for you, Maggie.  	Does that mean you're going to stay?
Can you climb faster than they can shoot?	We've got to try something. Think we'll get a finder's fee after they get all their "luggage"?
We've got to try something. Think we'll get a finder's fee after they get all their "luggage"?	Sure. All the bullets we can eat.
Sure. All the bullets we can eat.	That's not what really worries me.
Fetch.	I'll need the ice axe.
I'll need the ice axe.	You've got to be kidding.
You've got to be kidding.	Okay. How about some tape?
I don't trust him.	Where could he go?
Where could he go?	I'd rather he didn't show us. We don't need two guides.
Radar lost it after it went low here.  	We have to assume it went down in the storm.
Is this it?	Yeah. This is it.
Still interested in staying alive?	There's a way to cross over to the top in about half a day.  
End of the line!	You heard me! Drop the guns!
You heard me! Drop the guns!	So, I'm going to give you a three-count to figure out how to turn the safety off.  
So where is the goddamn thing ?  That one's got me all aflush with curiosity.  	You'll be the first to know.
It's Evan. Parachute failed.	Damn fool. Why would anybody try that in the middle of a storm.
He's on the way up. I could hear that jacket before I could see it.	Then get the money, kill him and get back here. Now.
Rotten weather for a climb, huh? I have two questions I'd like to trouble you with. Ready?	This first one's easy. Do you know a man named Gabe Walker?
This first one's easy. Do you know a man named Gabe Walker?	Yes. Where is he?
It hurts just looking at you.	Try it from this side. Do you still have your radio?
I've got something here.	Let's have it.
Let's have it.	There's an unconfirmed report of a distress call made from a plane that crashed.
What are we going to do?	Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you got into this.
Goodbye, Frank.	Time for number three. Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere.
Time for number three. Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere.	Fuck off.
You would have lived longer, if you weren't such a smartass.	You telegraphed this kind of stunt with that joke snowman. Too bad for you we're not all gullible.
You telegraphed this kind of stunt with that joke snowman. Too bad for you we're not all gullible.	Good thing for Qualen you are.
Good thing for Qualen you are.	What do you mean?
(beat) Am I wrong ?  Give him a buzz.  	You've got my attention.
Qualen's not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer.  	Right. So I'd better have one less problem when he arrives.
Stalemate, isn't it?	Not any more.
Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear hats, either. That's why I quit. You all right?	I feel better than you look. I can live with that.
I feel better than you look. I can live with that.	Hardly seems worth zipping, huh? Frank?
Now what?	I have no fucking idea. Empty.
I have no fucking idea. Empty.	Not for long.
(pause) No rush.  I'm sure you've got lots of time.  	All right. Drop the gun first.
Get out.	Run! (she doesn't) Run!
