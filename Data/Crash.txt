This is your car?	You'll tear your gloves.
You'll tear your gloves.	I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
You haven't told me where we're going.	Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
I work in the immigration department there.	Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.

You're kidding.	She dropped it off for you.  
She dropped it off for you.  	You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?	That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.	He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.  
Oh, God. What happened? Here, lie down.	But he started to feel nauseous on the way back.  I'm sure it's concussion.  
It's like a bed on wheels.  It must smell of semen. . .  	It does.
It does.	Do you find him attractive?

No. But when he's in that car...	Have you seen his penis?
Have you seen his penis?	I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?	Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.	And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?

What does he want from you?	Hard to say.
Hard to say.	I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.	Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.	You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?	At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.

I thought that was you, up there.	My last lesson's next week. James... my car...
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking-lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?	One of your suitors?
One of your suitors?	One of my suitors.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.	I'd like to go back. James...
