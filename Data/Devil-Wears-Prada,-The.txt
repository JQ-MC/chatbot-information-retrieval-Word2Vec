. .  	Right.
Right.	 Also, I need to see what Nigel has called in for Gwyneth's second cover try. . .  
So you don't read Runway?	No.
I'm not sure I have anything to wear to work.  	You're going to be answering phones and getting coffee. You need a ballgown for that?

Actually, I'm from Cincinnati.	No, it's not possible. Not you.
Man the desk at all times. Got it.	 (big drumroll, she beams) I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall

There you are, Emily. How many times do I have to scream your name?	Actually, it's Andy.
Get him on the phone.	And Emily.

Is it always like this?	No. Sometimes it's busy.
I told you.	I thought you were kidding.

Corn chowder. Interesting choice.	You do know that cellulite is one of the ingredients of corn chowder.
I don't see any reason to change everything about myself because I have this job.  	You're right. That's what this multi- million dollar industry is all about. Inner beauty.
Mr. Ravitz.	Nigel. Issue going well?
Nigel. Issue going well?	Our biggest September ever.

I'm sorry... this is Andy Sachs, Miranda's new assistant.	Congratulations, young lady. A million girls would kill for that job.

Oh please. Not this again.	Why did you even bother applying to law school?
Why did you even bother applying to law school?	Because it's what you wanted. This is what I want.
Because it's what you wanted. This is what I want.	This? Being a secretary?
Except for me. . .  because I was not there.  	I'm so sorry, Miranda.

Oh, no. No way...	You do it with the other girls.
You do it with the other girls.	The other girls are different. They really want it.
I'll talk to her. Tell her she needs to get her own scrambled eggs.	Come on, guys. Give me the phone!
Hi. I, um... I have to go.	But you want to stay. You've never been to a party like this.
But you want to stay. You've never been to a party like this.	God, I love it when total strangers tell me how I feel.

I actually reviewed your collection of essays for my college paper.  	Did you mention my good looks and killer charm?
Did you mention my good looks and killer charm?	No, but I did point out some factual errors and a penchant for confessional semi-fiction that borders on self-indulgent.
You're kidding. Oh, that's too bad. You'll never survive Miranda.	Excuse me?
Excuse me?	You're smart, you're nice, you have a point of view. You can't do that job.
You're smart, you're nice, you have a point of view. You can't do that job.	I have to go.

Where are you going?	Gonna go get me some of that Wall Street cash.  
Gonna go get me some of that Wall Street cash.  	But I came back so we could hang out.
They're not expecting us until Tuesday. Did she say why?	Yes, she explained every detail of her decision-making, then we brushed each other's hair and gabbed about American Idol.
What's a preview, anyway?	Miranda insists on seeing all the designer's collections before they show them.
And then there's the pursing of the lips.	What does that mean?
You got the sketches for your dress.	Yes. I did.
Yes. I did.	Thank you.
Thank you.	This season I started to think about the intersection of East and West...
This season I started to think about the intersection of East and West...	The modern woman as Geisha meets rock star, with a little Desperate Housewives thrown in.  
And I need to see the look book for the November denim shoot.	It's in the car.
It's in the car.	Fine.
Guard this with your life.	Oh, and she actually called me Andrea instead of Emily.  Isn't that great? 
I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.	Of course. I'll run down to Barnes & Noble right now.
Of course. I'll run down to Barnes & Noble right now.	Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?
Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?	Not that I can recall.

Of course I remember you, Miranda Girl. You shaken off the college boyfriend yet?	Listen. I desperately need a favor. And I don't know many people in the book world...
Listen. I desperately need a favor. And I don't know many people in the book world...	The Harry Potter manuscript? You've gotta be kidding.
The Harry Potter manuscript? You've gotta be kidding.	I'm sorry to ask you. I'm desperate.
I'm sorry to ask you. I'm desperate.	Just tell her it can't be done. You'll have to come up with a plan B.
(to the BARRISTA) Can you make it extra hot ?  Like, center of the sun hot? 	Sorry, my boss is particular. Are you sure? You're my last shot. (sighs) All right, well, thanks for trying.
Sorry, my boss is particular. Are you sure? You're my last shot. (sighs) All right, well, thanks for trying.	Sounds like a great job.
One copy? What are my twins supposed to do with that... share?	Actually I made two copies. And had them color-copied, re-set and bound so they wouldn't look like manuscripts.
So you quit, but you're still doing the twins' science project. Big of you.	I just had a moment of weakness.  That's all.  
I just had a moment of weakness.  That's all.  	Either that or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.
That's all it is, Nate. Just a job.	No, no. It's an important magazine. That's what you said, right?
No, no. It's an important magazine. That's what you said, right?	That's important.  A list of the 10 best wrinkle creams under $500.  That's important.  
Gstaad. It's a ski resort. In Switzerland.	See? I now live with someone who knows that. Thank you, Miranda Priestly.
See? I now live with someone who knows that. Thank you, Miranda Priestly.	Nate, it's not like I run the magazine. I just work there, remember?
Nate, it's not like I run the magazine. I just work there, remember?	I'm the same person I was. I still want the same things.
What about these? These are pretty nice.	And this skirt? Okay. What about this?
I want to make sure before the benefit that you are both fully prepped on the guest list.	Um... I thought only the first assistant went to the benefit.
I don't see why she needs both of us.	Don't look at me. This is the last thing I want to do.
Don't look at me. This is the last thing I want to do.	I've been studying for weeks.  
I've been studying for weeks.  	I need to learn all these people by tonight?
I need to learn all these people by tonight?	Don't be silly.
Oh, I love that. I'll call you the second I'm leaving.	Will that fit me?
Oh my God, Andy. You look... chic.	And you look... so thin.
It's definitely working.	I know. I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.
I know. I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.	That's... great.
You can go. I've got it from here.	Are you sure?
Turns out I'm not as nice as you thought.  	God I hope not.
God I hope not.	If you didn't have that stupid boyfriend, I'd have to whisk you away right here and now.
If you didn't have that stupid boyfriend, I'd have to whisk you away right here and now.	Do you really say things like that to people?
Do you really say things like that to people?	Evidently.
Yes, please.  See what you can do.  	Everything okay?
Everything okay?	Yeah. I'm... fine.
Get these to Miranda right away. Tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rochas.	Great. No problem.
Great. No problem.	Hey. Adjust the attitude. Don't make me feed you to one of the models.

Sorry. Busy day. And my personal life is going down the drain. That's all.	Join the club. You start to do well at work, that's what happens.
She hasn't eaten in weeks. I can't do that, Miranda. I can't.	If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future at Runway or any other publication.
I didn't have a choice. You know how she is.	Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse.
Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse.	What a load of bollocks.  
What a load of bollocks.  	Look, I know you're mad. And I don't blame you.
Look, I know you're mad. And I don't blame you.	Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos.
Okay, now you're scaring me.	Lily, this show is amazing. I am so proud of you.
Lily, this show is amazing. I am so proud of you.	I wasn't sure you would be able to make it.
I wasn't sure you would be able to make it.	What are you talking about? I wouldn't miss this.

 I wouldn't care if you were out all night pole dancing if you did it with some integrity 	So now I have no integrity. Great.
So now I have no integrity. Great.	You made fun of the Runway girls.  And now you've become one of them.  
You made fun of the Runway girls.  And now you've become one of them.  	That's absurd.
I do. I really do.	Then maybe this trip is coming at a good time. Maybe we should take a break.

Wait. Don't tell me, The boyfriend is non plus? Je suis tr�s tr�s desol�.	Oh, you're so full of it. You are not desol� at all.
By all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me.	Okay, so, first of all, let's put Jay- Z at my table.
Okay, so, first of all, let's put Jay- Z at my table.	But your table is full.

Of course.	Priestly".

We really need to figure out where to put Donatella because she's barely speaking to anyone.	Miranda, I'm so sorry. If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.

I'm just saying, yes, there are things she does I don't agree with, but...	 You hate her Just admit it.  She's a notorious sadist, and not in the good way.
